            But since taking over Twitter last month, Musk has cut around half of Twitter's workforce, including many
            employees tasked with fighting disinformation, while an unknown number of others have voluntarily quit. He
            also tweeted that he planned to publish "Twitter Files on free speech suppression," but without clarifying

            In recent weeks, half of Twitter's top 100 advertisers have announced they are suspending or have otherwise
            "seemingly stopped advertising on Twitter," an analysis conducted by nonprofit watchdog group Media Matters
            found.Musk on Monday accused Apple of also having "mostly stopped advertising on Twitter."

                    Elon Musk said Apple Inc. has “fully resumed” advertising on Twitter Inc., further de-escalating a
                    brewing war between two of the world’s most influential tech companies.
                    Musk made the comments during a Twitter Spaces conversation on Saturday, adding that Apple is the
                    largest advertiser on the social media network. The billionaire, who didn’t elaborate further on
                    Apple, spoke for more than two hours from his private plane during the chat, which had more than
                    90,000 listeners.

                    Musk blasted Apple last week, accusing the maker of iPhones and Mac computers of mostly stopping
                    advertising on Twitter and threatening to withhold the site from its App Store. In taking aim at
                    Apple, Musk risked a war with the world’s most valuable company and a top advertisers at a time when
                    other companies were pulling their marketing from Twitter.
                    Following his barrage of attacks on Apple, Musk met with Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and
                    said the two had a “good conversation” and “resolved the misunderstanding about <mark>Twitter
                        potentially being removed from the App Store</mark>.” Musk said Cook was “clear that Apple
                    never considered doing so.”

                    Since Musk’s takeover, a string of companies have suspended advertising on Twitter, including
                    General Mills Inc. and Pfizer Inc., following uncertainty over whether the platform will revise its
                    policies to combat hate speech and misinformation. On Saturday, Musk posted a tweet thanking
                    advertisers for returning to Twitter.

                    Apple is one of the biggest advertisers on Twitter, and a Reuters report pointed out that the iPhone
                    maker was the top advertiser in the first quarter of 2022. After Musk's formal takeover in October,
                    Apple spent roughly $131,600 on Twitter ads between November 10 and 16, down from $220,800 between
                    October 16 and 22. Although reasons remain unclear, Apple likely stopped advertising on the platform
                    as it does not want its ads to be placed under controversial or sensitive tweets, since Musk plans
                    to revamp Twitter to protect "free speech." Apple is not the only company that stopped advertising
                    on Twitter. Many automobile companies like Audi and General Motors suspended ads on Twitter last
                    month. General Mills, the food company known for the breakfast cereal Cheerios and ice cream
                    Haagen-Dazs, also has stopped ads on Twitter. Pfizer, a pharmaceutical company that played a
                    critical role in the COVID-19 vaccine, reportedly suspended its advertising on the social media
                    platform last month.

                    Meanwhile, the managing editor of news website Platformer, Zoe Schiffer, tweeted that Amazon is also
                    planning to resume advertising on Twitter at about $100 million a year. The company may increase
                    expenditure on ads once the situation with Twitter and Musk is more stable.
